# md-in-js

Material Design constants (animation curves & durations, colors, shadows, etc...) all defined in JS.

## What is it?

md-in-js is just an assortment of JS constants and values used in material design. It's not a framework or a replacement for [material components](https://material.io/components/), [material design lite](https://getmdl.io/), [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/), et al.

## Why?

So you can use animation durations, colors in js components, or roll your own css following material design guidelines. I got really tired of redeclaring these constants throughout my projects.
